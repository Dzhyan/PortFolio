FIRST PORTFOLIO PAGE

-General idea?
Basic nav line with about me, contact, and then the projects Ive built. Later on it will be nice to display them categorised and maybe tiled or something, but for now Im happy to line them up in the nav bar as there are only a handful.

Find a good style example to use?


--Ideas so far
I want less flash, more content. No chrome pipes please, just highly organised, skillful, and efficient functionality. I hate transition scrolling and elements that fly all over the place confusing the fuck out of everyone. Yuk. Clean and sober, but with a refined high quality of actual content, thank you.
